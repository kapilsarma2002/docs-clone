This project is a clone of google docs, it has been built using React, TS and Tailwind CSS (
my first experience using tailwind) and deployed to Vercel. The Skeloton od the page is built using Flexbox. It consists of three components Titlebar, Sidebar and Editor.
Titlebar: Consists of all the options for dropdowns, Title, Share button and Profile pic. Again built using flexbox.
Sidebar: Consists of all the google apps and links to them. Pretty simple compared to titlebar.
Editor: Built using react-draft and draft-js.
This and just the basic UI of the google docs and can be updated later and more functionalities can be added later.
